1. Books with text often include words not used in ordinary conversations. They prompt discussions about objects, events, people, and ideas that may or may not be in the child’s everyday environment.
2. As appropriate, work with parents to find sources of free or low-cost children’s books.;

PD-HLTH 8: Personal Care Routines: Dressing,"Responding Earlier, Responding Later, Exploring Earlier, Exploring Later, Building Earlier","Interactions/Teaching Strategies, Professional Growth and Development",HSELOF,"Health, Safety, and Nutrition","▶Talk with children during routine care such as diapering/toileting, dressing, mealtime, and naptime. Describe what you and the children are doing and how these routines keep them healthy and safe.'
▶As children are able, encourage them to participate in and complete parts of the routine on their own (e.g., infant lifts his arms so you can take his shirt off; toddler gets her ""lovey"" before lying down on a mat for nap).;
▶Establish practices for self-care such as washing hands, brushing teeth, managing sneezes, and safety (e.g., rules for safe play behavior, such as not standing on tables or chairs and not putting small objects in the mouth; using indoor and outdoor play equipment safely; holding an adult's hands or a rope when crossing the street). Use gentle verbal reminders, gestures, physical prompts, and visuals (e.g., photos, illustrations) to help children learn and remember what, why, and how to do it and when it is done.;
▶Make sure to follow your program's policies and procedures for promoting good oral health for infants and toddlers. For example, clean an infant's teeth and gums regularly with a clean, damp washcloth or toothbrush with soft bristles and a small head made for infants. Put a smear of fluoride toothpaste on the toothbrush. Brush the child's teeth or help the child brush. Children need help with brushing until their hand coordination is better.
▶Balance keeping toddlers safe with allowing them to take and manage age-appropriate risks as they explore their indoor and outdoor environments. Allowing children to take safe risks in play helps them test their physical limits, develop perceptual motor abilities, and learn to avoid and adjust to environments and activities that may be dangerous.;
For example, if a child is attempting to walk up a hill that is slippery, say, ""This hill is slippery. Let's take our time walking up,"" instead of, ""Be careful, be careful."" The first suggestion offers concrete guidance for how to manage a physical challenge; the second does not and may stop the child from exploring the hill and his ability to climb it.
▶Talk with parents of infants about the food their child eats. Coordinate offering new food to infants with when parents do so.;
▶Serve all foods, including fruit which is often considered dessert, at the same time. Allow children to eat food in the order or combination they prefer.;
▶During mealtimes, encourage children to let you know when they are full. With infants, watch for cues (e.g., turning face away from bottle or spoon). The goal is for children to eat what they need, not to ""clean the plate."";
▶Provide toddler-sized utensils to encourage self-feeding.

"ATL-REG 2: Self-Comforting, ATL-REG 5: Self-Control of Feelings and Behavior","Exploring Earlier, Exploring Later",Family Engagement,Frog Street Toddler,What to do if your child has a tantrum,"When your child has a tantrum, follow these simple steps: 
1. Use words to describe what you believe to be the cause of the emotional outburst. This will often reduce the intensity of the tantrum because part of the issue is that your child thinks you don’t understand what he wants. 
2. Then, walk away and let your child cry it out. If you try to reason with a child during this time, it will only extend the length of the fuss. 
3. Be consistent. For example, if you don’t allow snacks before dinner, make this a consistent rule in all cases.

For example, if 12 month old Marco cries a long time each day after his mom leaves you can recognize that Marco is at an age where new attachments are more difficult to establish. When taking Marco from his mom, greet him first and say ""Mommy is going to work. She will be back later to pick your up"". Turn him outward toward the classroom so he can focus on the environment. Try making mildly silly faces. This will allow you to connect with Marco in a non-threatening way. Talk soothingly or sing a gentle song. These activities not only help calm a stressful child but they also build a bond. Hold Marco in your lap and read him a book to further strengthen your bond. Give it time.
